	to parse complex docs like NewsML feeds

	in a rational way

	- Brought PHP version more up to date with XML::Mini (Perl) implementation
	- Split the source into seperate files to aid in maintenance (see the classes directory)
	- Created the fromArray()/toArray() functions.  This allows for super easy XML creation 
	  and parsing

Sun Dec 15 12:56:59 EST 2002 -
	- Update to Perl version to make XML::Mini more compatible with older Perl installs,
	thanks to Nigel Wetters from rivalsdm.com

	- Added the ability to removeChild() and removeAllChildren() for Element objects
	- Added the ability to prependChild() and insertChild(CHILD, INDEX)
